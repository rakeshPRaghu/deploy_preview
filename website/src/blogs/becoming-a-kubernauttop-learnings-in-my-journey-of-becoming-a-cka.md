Hello, my fellow Kubernetes Developers,

I would like to tell you about my experience with the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam.

I was first exposed to Kubernetes when I started to work on OpenEBS, a Container Attached Storage solution.

After working on the project for a period of time, I thought about taking the CKA certification exam. I took approximately one and a half months to practice and get my hands dirty. I completed the exam on the 28th of December 2018 and was excitedly able to pass the exam.

## CKA is about making friends!

When I was involved in developing the OpenEBS control plane, I was required to understand some basic concepts, specifically, the storage concepts of Kubernetes.

I started to explore Kubernetes Docs which, in my opinion, is the greatest source for learning Kubernetes. I applied my newfound knowledge to the project. My in-house team members my company MayaData, namely Karthik, Amit, Vishnu, and Kiran just to name a few, groomed me and provided me with the right knowledge. From there, I started to develop more interest in the subject.

In mid-November 2018, I started to do an exhaustive walk through of Kubernetes docs and practiced it.

Obviously, there were a few things that did not make sense to me as Kubernetes covers a vast domain, e.g. Network, Linux, etc.

Throughout my experience, I frequently used the Kubernetes Slack channel and asked questions. I also began to attend local meetups. From there, my journey in making friends and a Kubernetes Mastermind began. I met Suraj Narwade on one of the meetups, where he shared his experience on how he learned Kubernetes.

I came to know about the Kubernaut Slack channel, space where you can join and ask about Kubernetes-related information, such as setting up CNI, performing workload operations, etc.

This journey was very exciting, and it became a journey to make new friends and, of course, this led to becoming a CKA.

## Preparation and Tips

- Go through the Kubernetes docs exhaustively, especially the concepts and task sections, so that when you see a question you can easily open the relevant topic in docs quickly.
- Practice with Kubectl, e.g. create a deployment, service etc., without writing YAML.
[https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/)

- Avoid writing YAMLs as much as possible in the exam.
- Donâ€™t just read the docs, but put them into practice.
- Know about systemctl commands.
- Set up your own cluster from scratch using [Kubernetes Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). I applied a little trick here; first I became familiar with basic Kubernetes constructs, played with workloads(e.g. Deployment, daemon set, etc), services etc., on an already configured Kubernetes cluster. Then I did it the hard way.
- Some folks also advise studying books and other learning materials, but I personally did not follow any books.

I will paste some useful resource links that might be helpful in addition to the Kubernetes docs.
