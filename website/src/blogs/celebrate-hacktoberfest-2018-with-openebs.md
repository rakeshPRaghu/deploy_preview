The 5th edition of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is around the corner and it will be the second [Hacktoberfest](https://openebs.io/hackfests/hacktoberfest-2018) experience for the OpenEBS community. All of us are excited!

In August 2017, OpenEBS community began growing and it was a beginning to building a strong foundation for an open source project. We were first introduced to Hacktoberfest by friends & peers at the DigitalOcean Bangalore Meetup and were interested in participating in it. We enlisted OpenEBS as one of the projects participating in Hacktoberfest 2017. We were pleasantly surprised by the participation and enthusiasm that Hacktoberfest attracts from developers around the world. The result was that the OpenEBS community grew by 20+ new contributor friends with ~100 PRs.

We are excited to announce that OpenEBS would be participating in Hacktoberfest 2018 as well! Look for latest updates [here](https://openebs.io/hacktoberfest)

## How do you get started with Hacktoberfest?

GitHub makes it really simple for contributors to get started. Just search for the tag ‚Äú[hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?l=&amp;q=state%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;type=Issues&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93)‚Äù at the GitHub level. Within a few minutes, you can filter tens of issues to start working on that which matches your interest. First timers can look out for ‚Äúgood first time‚Äù tag. Anyways, here are the quick steps for you if you are interested in participating.

1. Register at [DigitalOcean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) website and provide your mailing address so that their system knows you are participating and can send you the t-shirt and stickers later. Well, we all want them, a matter of pride üôÇ
2. Next, filter the issues with [hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?l=&amp;q=state%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;type=Issues&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93) tag, and further filter out based on language, documentation, good first issue, etc
3. Pick up few issues and let the author of the issues know that you want to fix them and start the interaction.
4. Send a PR and with the continued interaction, you will eventually be able to get your PR merged. After sometime, your t-shirt and stickers will arrive. In the meantime enjoy working on more issues you enjoy solving.

## Get additional swag from OpenEBS

To help beginners start their open-source journey, there will be 101-level courses in the mornings. All workshop participants will receive help from our team in getting started, and they all get to win the special edition t-shirts. Bring your own hacking gear, such as laptops!

### **MULE HAS FRIENDS**

This year our theme for Hacktoberfest is ‚Äú**MULE HAS FRIENDS**‚Äù. OpenEBS collaborates contributions from cloud native storage and data management. We want to drive the hacktoberfest enthusiasm to additional projects such as Weave Scope, Rancher LongHorn and Heptio ARK. This October, we are looking to help and receive more contributions for these open-source projects as well.

Happy hacking!!
